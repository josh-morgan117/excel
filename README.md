# excel helper files
File "Copy only rows with data.xlsm" contains a macro that will combine multiple sheets in a spreadsheet into one single sheet. This is helpful if your data has the same column headers but is split up into multiple sheets for whatever reason. The macro will only copy cells with data and will ignore empty cells.

I'll post the raw code as well with comments.
